**NOTES:**

- [AbuseIpDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com "AbuseIpDB") returns a maximum of 10,000 IP addresses with a basic user account.

- [AbuseIpDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com "AbuseIpDB") allows a maximum of 5 daily requests to their API.

- I have NOT tested this script using an account upgrade.

- [AbuseIpDB API documentation can be found here.](https://docs.abuseipdb.com/#blacklist-endpoint "AbuseIpDB API Documentation")

## Installation

1. Sign up for an AbuseIPDB account to get your API key: www.abuseipdb.com. The API key used for this script is the "APIv2" key.

2. Clone or download this repository into your Nginx directory. *You must be the root user.* On Ubuntu, for example, clone into /etc/nginx/.

3. cd into abuseipdb-php-nginx-blacklist-create/ directory.

4. Copy config.dist.php to config.php and insert your key into the define('ABUSE_IP_DB_KEY', '<KEY HERE>'); block. Set the define('ABUSE_CONFIDENCE_SCORE', 80); to your liking. AbuseIPDB recommends somewhere between 75-100%.

5. Run the script using sudo or change to the root user and run the script, "php abuseipdb-blacklist-create.php"

6. At this point you should have a file named "nginx-abuseipdb-blacklist.conf" in the directory. It should contain a list of IP addresses on each line. For example, "deny ##.##.##.##;"

7. Add the following line near the top of the http section in your nginx.conf file:
```
    http {
            .....

            ## Block spammers and other unwanted visitors  ##
            include abuseipdb-php-nginx-blacklist-create/nginx-abuseipdb-blacklist.conf;

            ......
```
8. Test the Nginx configuration, "sudo nginx -t"

9. If all is well, reload Nginx. On Ubuntu, "sudo service nginx reload"

## Adding Your Own Blacklist IPs

1. Copy local-blacklist.conf.dist to local-blacklist.conf.

2. Add your deny lines to local-blacklist.conf. For example, "deny 00.00.00.00;"

3. Run the abuseipdb-blacklist-create.php file. "php abuseipdb-blacklist-create.php"

## Updating the Blacklist

1. Run the script using sudo or change to the root user and run the script, "php abuseipdb-blacklist-create.php"

2. Test the Nginx configuration, "sudo nginx -t"

3. If all is well, reload Nginx. On Ubuntu, "sudo service nginx reload"
